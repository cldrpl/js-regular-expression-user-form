# regular-expression-user-form

Hi!

This was a course example using Bootstrap CSS to create a User Form and to test out regular expressions in JavaScript.
It's testing the input, is-invalid, required after form-control/ added dynamically to generate the red warning that information is needed for bootstrap validation.
As well as the option for different user input fields.

Thanks! 
Mike
